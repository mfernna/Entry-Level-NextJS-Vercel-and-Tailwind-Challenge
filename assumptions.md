## axios

    I decided to use axios based on my comfort and time-spent working with this library, the high-quality utility it provides and also its simpleness.

## .env.example

    I have created the ".env.example" file so as to make easier the process of running the project by having a placeholder of the environment variables.

## Sonner

    I used Sonner to implement toasts to warn the user whenever the connection is very low and the website is taking too long to load something. This was a recommendation, I have always used Toastify.
